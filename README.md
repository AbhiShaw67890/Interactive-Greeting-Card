## Customization
This project is designed with customization in mind, allowing you to tailor the website for various occasions. By modifying the HTML and CSS files, you can personalize the site to better suit your needs. Here are some suggestions for customization:

- **Wallpaper**: Change the `background-image` in the CSS file to alter the site's wallpaper, giving it a fresh look for the occasion.
- **Font**: Adjust the `font-family` and other font properties in the CSS to match the mood or theme you're aiming for.
- **Number of Papers**: Edit the HTML file to add or remove paper elements based on the amount of content you wish to include.
- **Paper Content**: Customize the text and images within each paper element in the HTML to convey your specific messages or greetings.
- **Styling**: Alter the colors, shadows, and borders in the CSS for each paper element to highlight them according to your theme.

These customizations allow for a wide range of expressions, making the project adaptable for anything from intimate personal messages to broader celebratory announcements.
